                As a passionate Web Developer, I specialize in creating dynamic and high-performance web applications. My expertise lies in MERN technologies (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and PHP MySQL,
                with foundational knowledge in C++. I have built a strong theoretical foundation through a HND in Digital Systems, Computer Science, and Networks. And Practical skills with a Web Developer professional certification at OpenClassrooms.
                 Although I lack professional experience, I am eager to apply my skills, continue learning, and evolve in the field of web development.

                <ListItem title="Passions and Interests" img={getImgUrl("about/cursorIcon.png")}>
                During my training at OpenClassrooms, I completed several practical projects, ranging from creating responsive websites to interactive web applications. These projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge and develop skills in project management,
                 problem-solving, and teamwork. My goal is to find an apprenticeship for September 2024 or secure a full-time position (CDI/CDD) to gain my first professional experiences,
                contribute to innovative projects, and further enhance my technical skills.

                Outside of web development, I am passionate about motorcycling, video games, and bodybuilding. These hobbies help me maintain a healthy work-life balance while cultivating discipline and determination. 
                I also have a keen interest in new technologies and love learning new things, which keeps me updated with the latest trends and innovations in web development.
